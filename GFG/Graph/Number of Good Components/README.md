# Number of Good Components
  Given an undirected graph with V vertices(numbered from 1 to V) and E edges. Find the number of good components in the graph.
A component of the graph is good if and only if the component is a fully connected component.
Note: A fully connected component is a subgraph of a given graph such that there's an edge between every pair of vertices in a component, the given graph can be a disconnected graph. Consider the adjacency list from index 1.

### Constraints:
```sh
Expected Time Complexity: O(V+E)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(depth of the graph)
1 ≤ V, E ≤ 104
```
